# Snake toy VM

A generalized toy virtual machine, assembler and debuger written in python. Intended as just a fun time waster over a few weekends for myself, but maybe there is some educational value to others?
- Keeping things simple, illustrating basic ideas behind classical computing, emulation and vms.
- Modular
  - Allows for definition of custom assembly sytaxes
  - Swapping/ extending instruction sets
 
*It's all virtual machines in virtual machins in virtual machines ... and Transformer models infrencing the output of virtual machines ... - Probaly someone*
